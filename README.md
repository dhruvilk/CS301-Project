# CS301-Project
The purpose of this assignment is to compete in the US Patent Phrase to Phrase matching competition on Kaggle. This repository will serve as the code and work of Robert Diasio, Ryan Kitson, and Dhruvil Kansara. The problem we are facing is to train models in semantic similarity to extract relevant information from patent documents. This is interesting to us because it would mean that the derivation of concepts and text from larger articles would be possible. The reading(s) we will read and examine to provide both context and background can be found on the Kaggle competition page here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/overview. The data we will be using has been provided to us by the competition sponsors and can also be found on the previously mentioned link. The method we propose is Exploratory Data Analysis.
